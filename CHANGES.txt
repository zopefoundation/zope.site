4.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.

- Include zcml dependencies in configure.zcml, added tests for zcml.


3.9.2 (2010-09-25)
------------------

- Added not declared, but needed test dependency on `zope.testing`.

3.9.1 (2010-04-30)
------------------

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctest' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

3.9.0 (2009-12-29)
------------------

- Avoid a test dependency on zope.copypastemove by testing the correct
  persistent behavior of a site manager using the normal pickle module.

3.8.0 (2009-12-15)
------------------

- Removed functional testing setup and dependency on zope.app.testing.

3.7.1 (2009-11-18)
------------------

- Moved the zope.site.hooks functionality to zope.component.hooks as it isn't
  actually dealing with zope.site's concept of a site.

- Import ISite and IPossibleSite from zope.component after they were moved
  there from zope.location.

3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
------------------

- Cleaned up the undeclared dependency on zope.app.publication by moving the
  two relevant subscriber registrations and their tests to that package.

- Dropped the dependency on zope.traversing which was only used to access
  zope.location functionality. Configure zope.location for some tests.

- Demoted zope.configuration to a testing dependency.

3.6.4 (2009-09-01)
------------------

- Set __parent__ and __name__ in the LocalSiteManager's constructor
  after calling constructor of its superclasses, so __name__ doesn't
  get overwritten with empty string by the Components constructor.

- Don't set __parent__ and __name__ attributes of site manager in
  SiteManagerContainer's ``setSiteManager`` method, as they're
  already set for LocalSiteManager. Other site manager implementations
  are not required to have those attributes at all, so we're not
  adding them anymore.

3.6.3 (2009-07-27)
------------------

- Propagate an ObjectRemovedEvent to the SiteManager upon removal of a
  SiteManagerContainer.

3.6.2 (2009-07-24)
------------------

- Fixed tests to pass with latest packages.

- Removed failing test of persistent interfaces, since it did not test
  anything in this package and used the deprecated ``zodbcode`` module.

- Fix NameError when calling ``zope.site.testing.siteSetUp(site=True)``.

- The ``getNextUtility`` and ``queryNextUtility`` functions was moved to
  ``zope.component``.  While backward-compatibility imports are provided, it's
  strongly recommended to update your imports.

3.6.1 (2009-02-28)
------------------

- Import symbols moved from zope.traversing to zope.location from the new
  location.

- Don't fail when changing component registry bases while moving ISite
  object to non-ISite object.

- Allow specify whether to create 'default' SiteManagementFolder on
  initializing LocalSiteManager. Use the ``default_folder`` argument.

- Add a containment constraint to the SiteManagementFolder that makes
  it only available to be contained in ILocalSiteManagers and other
  ISiteManagementFolders.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Remove old unused code. Update package description.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

3.5.1 (2009-01-27)
------------------

- Extracted from zope.app.component (trunk, 3.5.1 under development)
  as part of an effort to clean up dependencies between Zope packages.
